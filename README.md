# Bookstore

## Short overview

This software is designed to manage a bookstore's operations, including tracking inventory, sales, and employee performance. It features a three-level user system with different views and permissions for Librarian, Manager, and Administrator roles.

The Librarian can check out books and process book requests, while the Manager can add new books to the stock and monitor employee performance. The Administrator has access to all functions and can manage employees, track income and cost data, and demote or promote other employees. Although each role has its own specific responsibilities, every role has access to the functions of lower-level roles.

The software can generate printable bills and provide statistics on sales and purchases.
